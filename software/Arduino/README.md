# Retro ROM Tester

Arduino code was developed with Arduino IDE 1.8.19 but there is no reason why it should not work with later versions. 
No special libraries are required. 

If you experience intermittent issues reading and validing hashes check that the ROM pins are not corroded. During my testing I found a pile of Commodore PET ROM's that were badly corroded and gave intermittent reading issues until the pins were cleaned up.
